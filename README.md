# Introduction-to-System-Integration-and-Architecture

In the subject Introduction to System Integration and Architecture, I am really looking forward to learning how different systems work together. 
I want to understand how hardware and software are connected and how they support each other to make a system work properly. I am curious about 
how everything fits together and how the whole system is organized. I think this subject will give me a better idea of how systems are designed 
and how integration is important to make things run smoothly.

I also hope to get some hands-on experience. I want to try doing small projects where I can connect different parts of a system and maybe even 
face some problems that I will have to solve. I think this will help me practice using tools and techniques that are actually used in real work-
places. I’m excited to see how what we learn in class applies to real-life situations and how systems are actually built in the IT world.

Most of all, I hope this subject will help me improve my problem-solving and thinking skills. I want to feel more confident in analyzing systems
and designing solutions in the future. I believe that what I will learn here will not only help me in school but will also give me a good founda-
tion for my future career in IT or technology. I’m excited to see how I can use this knowledge in real situations and hopefully become better at 
understanding and working with systems step by step.
